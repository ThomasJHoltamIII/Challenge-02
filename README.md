# Challenge-02

## Description

This is my Portfolio, I plan on adapting it further as I grow as a devoloper. 


## Features

My name, photo, links to my work, an about me section, and a contact section The header links work and will scroll the page when clicked. The project image(s) are titled with room for more, and if you click on the image, you will be taken to the application.
It is also using Flex CSS and viewport settings to display well on phones and other devices.
